Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life
Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the bestAnd always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of lifeIf life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of lifeFor life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhowSo, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breathLife's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of lifeC'mon Brian, cheer up!Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of lifeWorse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of lifeI mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!Always look on the right side of life...Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
