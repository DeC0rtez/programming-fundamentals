# W12 - Dash

Using [US education dataset](http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/States.csv) dataset ([description](http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/carData/States.html)), create Dash application.

User input:
  - X-axis variable (average teacher's salary, population, percentage of graduating high-school students, state spending on public education)
  - Y-axis variable (SATM score, SATV score)
  
 After user will select variables, application will show scatterplot for different US states.
 
 Deploy application on Heroku.
 
 **BONUS** If user clicks on any point in scatter plot, summary table appears showing information for this state (average teacher's salary, population, percentage of graduating high-school students, state spending on public education).
